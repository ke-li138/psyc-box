# pysc-box
club designed for people to communicate with therapists to alleviate their mental stresses.

This project requires three types of users, the administrators, the users, and the therapists. In order to create a textfield to identify the type of the user, I decided to create a new model calld NewUser which is inherited from the model User. 

If you're not logged in, you could only see the questions asked by the users and the replies written by the therapists posted on the Home Page.
