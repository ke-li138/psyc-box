# pysc-box
A platform designed for people to communicate with therapists to alleviate their mental stresses.

This project requires three types of users, the administrators, the users, and the therapists. If there is some issue that you would share, please register for an account and submit your issue; if you would like to be therapist, contact us at the email address at the bottom of the website!

If you're not logged in, you could only see the questions asked by the users and the replies written by the therapists posted on the Home Page.
